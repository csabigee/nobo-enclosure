# nobo-enclosure
A 3D model for the nobo thermostat.
I used OpenScad. 2 pieces: a base and a lid.
On the base there are 4 holes for the M3 screw inlets, which are used to secure the PCB and the lid with 4 M3 screws.
The lid has a debossed NOBO logo. The material at the letter "O" is thinner, so the LED placed on the PCB can shine through.
